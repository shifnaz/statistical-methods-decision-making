Application of probability distributions and hypothesis testing for data-driven decisions.

# Statistical Methods for Decision Making (2020)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies statistical techniques to solve three distinct business problems using Python. It demonstrates the ability to move beyond simple EDA into hypothesis testing and probability theory.

## 📊 The Three Business Problems
1. **Wholesale Customer Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on annual spending to identify the most profitable regions and channels.
2. **Student Survey Insights:** Application of probability theory (Conditional and Joint probability) to analyze student demographics and graduation intentions.
3. **Manufacturing Quality Control:** Using Hypothesis Testing (Two-sample T-tests) to determine if there is a significant difference in the moisture content of two types of shingles (A & B).

## 🛠️ Statistical Skills Applied
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Outlier identification and skewness analysis.
* **Probability:** Calculating conditional and joint probabilities from survey data.
* **Inference:** Performing T-tests and interpreting P-values to fail/reject Null Hypotheses.

## 💡 2026 Perspective
Looking back at this project, I see two key areas where my documentation standards have evolved:
1. **Markdown Integration:** Today, I would use Markdown cells to clearly explain the intent and business context behind each statistical test before running the code.
2. **Code Commenting:** I would include detailed comments within the code blocks to explain the logic of specific functions and parameters, making the notebook more accessible and reproducible for other team members.
